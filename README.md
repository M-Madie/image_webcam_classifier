# Deep Learning based image classification from webcam

This repository contains one of my projects as a data science student where I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of objects from 8 categories, and integrated it in a script that takes live images using a webcam and predicts the object category.

The repository includes the following files:
* image_classifier_object.ipynb - shows the process of image processing and model training and evaluation
* model_imageclassifier.h5 - saved trained model
* live_image_classifier.py - script that uses the trained model to make prediction on images taken from a live webcam
* utils.py - utils script
